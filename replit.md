# Overview

This is a static HTML webpage project now fully configured to run in the Replit environment. The project contains a simple HTML page with minimal content (heading and paragraph) plus analytics tracking code. The website is served using a Python HTTP server configured for Replit's proxy environment and is ready for both development and production deployment.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML Structure**: Uses a single HTML file (`index.html`) with basic document structure
- **Python HTTP Server**: Custom Python server (`server.py`) configured for Replit environment
- **Minimal Content Design**: Simple page layout with heading and paragraph elements
- **Analytics Integration**: Includes JavaScript tracking code (NS_CSM variables) for user analytics collection
- **Replit Configuration**: Server bound to 0.0.0.0:5000 with cache-control headers for development

## Page Structure
- **Document Type**: Standard HTML5 doctype declaration
- **Head Section**: Contains title element (currently empty) and analytics script
- **Body Content**: Basic semantic markup with h1 heading and paragraph

## Design Decisions
- **Simplicity First**: Minimal HTML structure suggests focus on content over complex functionality
- **Analytics Ready**: Early integration of tracking code indicates intention for user behavior monitoring
- **Standards Compliant**: Uses proper HTML5 structure and semantic elements

# External Dependencies

## Analytics/Tracking
- **Custom Analytics Script**: Embedded JavaScript code with NS_CSM namespace variables for tracking
  - Variables include: td (276714605), pd (275116667), u ("/clm10"), and col (hash string)
  - Appears to be a custom or enterprise analytics solution rather than standard Google Analytics

## Current Limitations
- **No CSS Framework**: No styling framework or custom CSS included
- **No JavaScript Libraries**: No external JavaScript libraries or frameworks
- **No Backend Integration**: Pure static HTML with no server-side components
